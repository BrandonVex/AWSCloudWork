AMAZON EFS

Manages NSF (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2 instances
EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-az
highly avaliable, scalable, expensive (3xgp2), pay per use

Use cases: Content management, web serving, data sharing, wordpress
uses NFSv4.1 protocol
uses security group to control access to EFS
compatible with linux based ami only
encryption at rest using KMS

POSIX file system (~linux) that has a standard file API
File system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning

EFS performance and storage

EFS Scal
  1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB+ /s throughput
  grow to pentabyte-scale network file systems, automatically
Performance Mode
  General purpose --latency-sensitive use cases
  max I/O -- higher latency, throughput, highly parallel
Throughput mode
  bursting -- 1TB = 50MiB/s + burst of up to 100MiB/s
  provisioned -- set your throughput regardless of storage size - ex: 1gib/s for 1tb/s
  elastic -- automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads
    up to 3gib/s for reads and 1gib/s for writes
    used for unpredictable workloads

--------------

Storage classes

Storage tiers 
  Standard: for frequently accessed
  Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower priuce to store. (Policy)

Availability and durability
  Standard: multi-az, great for prod
  one zone: one AZ great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA

over 90% in cost savings
