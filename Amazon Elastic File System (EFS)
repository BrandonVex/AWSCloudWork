AMAZON EFS

Manages NSF (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2 instances
EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-az
highly avaliable, scalable, expensive (3xgp2), pay per use

Use cases: Content management, web serving, data sharing, wordpress
uses NFSv4.1 protocol
uses security group to control access to EFS
compatible with linux based ami only
encryption at rest using KMS

POSIX file system (~linux) that has a standard file API
File system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning

-------------

EFS performance and storage

EFS Scale
  1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB+ /s throughput
  grow to pentabyte-scale network file systems, automatically
Performance Mode
  General purpose --latency-sensitive use cases
  max I/O -- higher latency, throughput, highly parallel
Throughput mode
  bursting -- 1TB = 50MiB/s + burst of up to 100MiB/s
  provisioned -- set your throughput regardless of storage size - ex: 1gib/s for 1tb/s
  elastic -- automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workload
    up to 3gib/s for reads and 1gib/s for writes
    used for unpredictable workloads

--------------

Storage classes

Storage tiers 
  Standard: for frequently accessed
  Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store. (Policy)

Availability and durability
  Standard: multi-az, great for prod
  one zone: one AZ great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA

over 90% in cost savings

How to mount the EFS on an instance

Create an Instance however you feel, and than under "configure storage," select "edit" file system.  (you will have to select a subnet)
Select EFS and make sure to add a shared file system and select your EFS you made. (AUTOMATE EVERYTHING)


--------------------

EFF vs EBS

EBS

Ebs volumes are attached to one instance at a time (except multi-attach with io1/io2)
  Locked at the AZ level
  gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases
  io1: can increase IO independently

To migrate an EBS volume across AZ
  take a snapshot
  restore the snapshot to another AZ
  EBS backups use IO and you shouldnt run them while your application is handling alot of traffic

Root EBS volumes of instances get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated (you can disable that)

EFS

Mounting 100s of instances across AZ's
EFS Share website files (Wordpress)
Only for Linux instances (POSIX)
EFS has a higher price point than EBS
Can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings
Remember EFS  vs EBS vs Instance store
