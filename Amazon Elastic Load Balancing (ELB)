What is load balancing?
A load balancer is a server that forwards traffic to multiple servers downstream.

Why use a load balancer?
Spread load across multiple downstream instances
expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
seamlessly handle failures of downsteam instances
do regular health checks to your instances
provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
enforce stickiness with cookies
high availability across zones
seperate public traffic from private network

----------------------------------------------------

Elastic Load balancer is a managed load balancer
  Aws guarantees that it will be working
  AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
  AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end
it is integrated with many AWS offerings / services
  ec2, ec2 auto scaling, amazon ecs
  AWS Certificate manager (ACM), cloudwatch
  route 53,  AWS WAF, AWS global accelerator

-------------------------------
Health checks

Elastic load balancer checks the EC2 instance to make sure the instance can take traffic

Health checks are crucial for load balancers
they enable the load balance to know if the instance it forward traffic to are available to reply to requests
the health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
if the response is not 200 (ok) than the instance is unhealthy

Protocol: HTTP
Port: 4567
Endpoint: /Health

Types of load balancers

AWS has 4 kinds of managed load balancers
Classic Load Balancer (v1 - older gen) --- 2009 -- CLB
  HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL
Application Load Balancer (v2 - new gen) -- 2016 -- ALB
  HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
Network Load Balancer (v2 - new gen) -- 2017 -- NLB
  TCP, TLS, UDP
Gateway Load Balancer -- 2020 -- GWLB
  Operates at layer 3 (Network) -- Ip protocol

Always try to use the newer generation load balancers as they provide more features.
some load balancers can be setup as internal and external ELBS (private/public)
