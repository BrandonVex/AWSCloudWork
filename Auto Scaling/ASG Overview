What is auto scaling group?
  When we deploy an EC2, in real life the load on your website can change drastically
  In the cloud, you can create and get rid of extra servers very quickly with ASG

the goal of an auto scaling group is to
  Scale out to match an increased load(increase)
  Scale in to match a decreased load (decrease)
  Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum of EC2 instances running at anytime
  Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
  Re-create an EC2 instance in case of a previous one is terminated (unhealthy)

ASG are free!!! you pay for the EC2 instances

---------------------------------------------

Minimum capacity (2)
Desired (4)
Maximum (8) (only need for extra traffic)
Scale out ^ (4)

ELB healthchecks and send information to Auto scaling group incase they need to restore an unhealthy EC2 instance

---------------------------

Attrributes

A launch template contains information on how to launch EC2 instances within your ASG

Launch template needs:
  AMI + Instance type
  EC2 User data
  EBS Volumes
  Security groups
  SSH key pair
  IAM Roles for your EC2 instances
  Network + Subnets information
  Load balancer information
  More!
MIN/MAX/INITIAL Capacity
Scaling Policies

--------------------------------

Cloudwatch alarms and scaling

It is possible to scale an ASG based on your CloudWatch alarms - Once alarm is triggered it will send information to the ASG to add more EC2 instances
An alarm monitors a metric (Cpu, custom metric)
Metrics such as CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances

  Based on the alarm
    We can create scale-out policies (increase)
    we can create scale-in policies (decrease)
