Global Users for out appliction

you have deployed an application and have global users who want to access directly but its only in 1 location
they go over the public internet which can add a lot of latency due to many hops of routers
we wish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency

Uses ANYCAST IP

leverage the AWS internal network to route your application
instead of putting it on the American server, just uses an EDGE location
2 anycast IPS are created for your application
the anycast ip send traffic directly to edge locations
the edge locations send the traffic to your application

Works with Elastic IP, EC2, ALB, NLB, public or private
consisatent performance
  intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
  no issue with client cache
  internal AWS network
Health checks
  global accelerator performs a health check for your applications
  helps makes your application global (failover instantly)
  great for disaster recovery
Security
  only 2 external ip need to be whitelisted
  DDoS protection thanks to AWS shield

-----------------------------

The both use the AWS global network and its edge locations
both services integrate with AWS shield 

Cloudfront:
  improves performance for both cacheable content
  Dynamic content
  Content is served at the edge
Global Accelerator:
  Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
  proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions
  good fit for NOn-HTTP use cases such as gaming, IoT, or voiceover IP (UDP, MQTT)
  Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses 
  GOOD FOR http USE CASES THAT REQUIRED DETERMINISTIC, FAST REGION FAILOVER
