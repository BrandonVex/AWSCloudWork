ECS - EC2 launch type

ECS = Elastic container service
Launch docker containers on AWS launch ECS tasks on ECS Clusters
ECS Launch type: you must provision and maintain the infrastructure
Each EC2 instance must run the ECS agent to register in the ECS cluster
AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers

-------------------------------

Fargat Launch type

Launch docker containers on AWS
You do not provision the infrastructure
Its all serverless
You just create task definitions
AWS just runs ECS tasks for you based on the CPU / RAM you need
To scale, just increase the number of tasks - no more EC2 instances

---------------------------------

IAM roles for ECS

EC2 instance profile (ec2 launch type only)
  Used by ECS agent
  Makes APi calls to ECS service
  send container logs to cloudwatch logs
  pull docker image from ecr
  reference sensitive data in secrets manager or SSM paramete store

ECS task role:
  Allows each task to have a specific role
  use different roles for the different ecs services you run
  Taks role is defined in the task definition

----------------------------------

Load balancer integrations

Application Load balancer supported and works for most use cases | works with fargate

Network load balancer recommended only for high throughput/high performance use cases, or to pair it with AWS private link

-------------------------------------

Data Volumes (EFS)

Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks
Works for both EC2 and Fargate launch types
Tasks running in any AZ will shate the same data in the EFS File system
Fargate + EFS = Serverless

Use cases: persistent multi az rshared storage for your containers
Amazon S3 cannot be mounted as a file system
