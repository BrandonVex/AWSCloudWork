EKS = Elastic Kubernetes service
it's a way to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
Kubernetes is an open-source system for the automatic deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
It is an alternative to ECS, with a similar goal but a different API
Open source = EKS
EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes, or fargate to deploy serverless containers
use cases:
  the company already uses Kubernetes on-premises and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes
Kubernetes is Cloud agnostic (all clouds)
