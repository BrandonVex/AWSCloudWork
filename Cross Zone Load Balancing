WITH CZLB

AZ 1          AZ 2
ALB           ALB
2 EC2         8 EC2
50%           50%  (this splits into 10% for ALL INSTANCES)

With cross zone load balancing each load balancer instance distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ's
Basically its an ALB for ALL AZ'S

WITHOUT CZLB

AZ 1          AZ 2
ALB           ALB
2 EC2         8 EC2
50%           50%  
(this than splits 25% in AZ1 to both instances while AZ is split 6.25% for 8 instances (50%))

Without cross zone balancing requests are distributed in the instances of the node of the ELB
Instead of 10% in 10 ec2 instances it will be 
Some instances will recieve more traffic
