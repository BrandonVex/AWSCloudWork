IoT devices ---->  Kinesis Data stream ---> Data firehose ---> S3 ---> SQS ---> Lambda ---> Athena ---> Pulls Fromm S3 ---> reporting bucket S3 ---> QuickSight ---> Redshift

-------------------

IoT Core allows you to harvest many data

from many IoT devices.

Kinesis is great real-time data collection,

and Firehose helps you with data delivery

to S3 in near real-time,

so one minute is the lowest frequency you can choose.

Lambda can help Firehose with data transformation,

and then, Amazon S3 can trigger notifications to SQS,

SNS or Lambda.

Lambda can subscribe to SQS, but we could, as I've said,

connected S3 to Lambda, and Athena is a serverless

SQL service, and we can store the results

of Athena directly back into S3.

And the reporting buckets contain analyzed data

and we can use reporting tools, such as QuickSight,

for visualization or Redshift,
