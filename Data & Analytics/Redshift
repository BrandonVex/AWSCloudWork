Redshift is based on PostgreSQLl, but its not used for OLTP
Its OLAP -- online anlytical proccessing
10x better performance than other data warehouses scales to PBs of data
columnar storage of data and parallel query engine
pay as you go based on the instances provisioned
has a SQL interface for performing queries
BI tool suck as Quicksight or Tableau intergrate with it
Vs Athena: Faster queries / joins / aggregations thanks to indexes

-------------

Redshift cluster

Leader node: for query planning, results aggregation
Compute node: for performing queries, send to the leader
you provision the node size in advanced
you can used reserved instances for cost savings

----------------

Snapshots and DR

Redshift has "MUlti az" for some cluster types
Snapshots are PIT backups of a cluster stored in S3
Snapshots are incrememental
you can resor a snapshot into a new cluster
automated: every 8 hour, 5GB or on a schedule
manual: snapshot is retained until you delete it
You can configure amazon redshift to automatically copy snapshot of a cluster to another AWS region

--------------------

Redshift spectrum

Query data that is already in S3 without loading it
Must have a redshift cluster available to start the query
the query is then submitted to thousands of Redshift Spectrum Nodes
COPY/UNLOAD =- Enhanced VPC routing
