Compatible API for PostgreSQL / MySQL, seperation of storage and compute
Storage: data is stored in 6 replicas across 3 AZ's - highly available, self-healing, auto scaling
Compute: Cluster of DB instance across multiple AZ, auto-scaling of read replicas
Cluster: Custom endpoints for writer and reader DB instances
Same security / monitoring / maintenance features as RDS
Know the backup and restore options for aurora
Aurora serverless - for unpredictable / intermittent workloads, no capacity planning
Aurora Multi-Master - for continuous writes failover
Aurora Global: up to 16 DB read instances in each region, < 1 second storage replication
Aurora Machine Leaning: perform ML using SageMaker and Comprehend on Aurora
Aurora Database cloning: new cluster from existing one, faster than restoring a snapshot
Use cases: Same as RDS, but with less maintenance, more flexibility, more performance, more features
