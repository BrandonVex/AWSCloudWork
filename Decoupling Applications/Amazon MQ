SQS, SNS are cloud-native services: proprietary protocols from AWS
Traditional applications running form on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we use Amazon MQ
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for
  RabbitMQ
  ActiveMQ
Amazon MQ doesnt "scale" as much as SQS/SNS
Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in multi-az with failover
Amazon MQ has both queue and topic features
