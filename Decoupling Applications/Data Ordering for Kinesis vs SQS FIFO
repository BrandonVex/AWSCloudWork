ordering data into kineses

Imagine you have 100 trucks on the road sending their GPS positions regularly into AWS
You want to consume the data in order for each truck, so that you can track their movement accuretly

Answer: send using a "partition key" value of the truck id
the same key will always go to the same shard

-----------------------------

Ordering data in SQS

For sqs standard there is no ordering
For sqs fifo, if you dont use a group ID, messages are consumed in the order they are sent with only one consumer
you want to scale the number of consumers, but you want messages to be "grouped" when they are related to each other
then you use a group ID (similar to partition key in kinesis)

---------------------

Lets assume 100 trucks, 5 shards, 1 SQS fifio

Kinesis data streams: 
  on average youll have 20 trucks per shard
  trucks will have their data ordered within each shard
  the maximum amount of consumers in parallel we can have is 5
  can recieve up to 5MB/s of data
SQS FIFO:
  You only have one SQS fifo queue
  you will have 100 Group ID
  you can have up to 100 consumers
  you have up to 300 messages per second (3000 if batching)

Based on use cases | to be better to use SQS FIFO.

If you want to have a dynamic number of consumers

based on the number of group IDs,

and sometimes it could be better to use Kinesis Data Stream

if you have say 10,000 trucks and you need

to send it lot of data,

and also have data ordering per shard

in your Kinesis Data Stream.
