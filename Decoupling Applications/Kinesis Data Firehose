It is a very helpful service that can take data form produces | same as data streams 
However, data stream/cloudwatch/and AWS IoT can be sent into kineses firehose.
you can use lambda to transform the data into serverless lambda function
than batch writes into destinations
  AWS Destinations:
    Amazon S3
    Amazon Redshift (Copy thru s3)
    Amazon OpenSearch
  3rd aprty destinations
    DataDog
    Splunk
    New Relic
    mongoDB
  Custom destinations
    HTTP Endpoint

2 extra options after
All or failed data can get sent into a s3 bucket

----------------

Fully managed server, no administration, automatic scaling, serverless
Pay for data going through firehose
Near Real Time
  60 seconds latency minimum for non full batches
  or minimum 1 MB of data at a time
Supports many data formats, conversions, transformations, compressions
Supports custom data transformations using AWS Lambda
Can send failed for all data to a backup s3 bucket

------------------------------------

Data streams vs Firehose

Kinesis data streams
  Streaming service for ingest at scale
  write custom code (producer/consumer)
  Real time (~200ms)
  Manage scaling yourself
  data storage for 1 to 365 days
  Supports replay capability
Kinesis data firehose
  Load streaming data into S3 / REDSHIFT / OPENSEARCH / 3RD PARTY / Custom HTTP
  Fully managed
  Near Real Time (buffer of 60 seconds)
  Automatic scaling
  No data storage (no replay)
  Doesnt support replay capabilities
