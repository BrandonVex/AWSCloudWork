Knises data streams bis a way to stream big data in your system
made of multiple shards | shard 1 to shard N
Provisioned ahead of time
Data split across all the shards

Producers send data into kinesis streams such as
  Applications
  Client
  SDK (lower level)
  KPL (higher level)
  Kinesis Agent
These produce records into kinesis made of 2 things | Partition key and Data Blob
The partition key makes sure what shard takes the data
Data blob is the data itself
1/MB second or 1000 MSG/S per shard
6 = 6mb/s etc...

Consumers are:
  Applications (KCL SDK)
  Lambda
  Kinesis Firehose
  Kinese data analytics
Consumer receives the partition key, sequence number (where record was in shard) and data blob
2 MB/sec (shared) per shard all consumers or 2MB/sec (enhanced) per shard per consumer


-----------------------------

Propeties:

Retention between 1 to 365 days
ability to reprocess (replay) data
Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it cant be deleted (immutability)
Data that shares the same partition goes to the same shard (ordering)
Produces: AWS SDK, Kinesis Produce Library (KPL), Kinesis agent
Consumers
  Write your own: KCL, AWS SDK
  Managed: Lambda, Kinesis firehose, kinesis data analytics

-----------------------

Capacity modes:

Provisioned mode:
  you choose the number of shards provisioned, scale manually or using API
  Each shard gets 1MB/s in (1000 records)
  Each shard gets 2MB/s out (classic or enhanced fan-out consumer)
  You pay per shard provisioned per hour

On-demand mode:
  No need to provision or manage the capacity
  Default capacity provisioned (4 MB/s in or 400 records)
  Scales automatically based on observed throughput peaks during the last 30 days
  Pay per stream per hour & data in/out per GB

----------------------

Security:

Within a Region
Control access/authorization using IAM policies
Encryption in flight using HTTPS endpoints
Encryption at rest using KMS
You can implement encryption/decryption of data on the client side (harder)
VPC endpoints available for kinesis to access withing a vpc (ec2 -> vpc -> kineses)
Monitor API calls by using cloudtrail
