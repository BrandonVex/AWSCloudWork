When a consumer requests messages from the queue, it can optionally wait for messages to arrive if there are none in the queue
this is called long polling
  Decrease latency
  Reduce API calls on SQS
LongPolling decreases the number of API calls made to SQS while increasing the efficiency and latency of your application
The wait time can be between 1 to 20 seconds
long polling is preferable to short polling
Long polling can be enabled at the queue level, or at the API level using WaitTimeSeconds

High polls low latency = long polling
