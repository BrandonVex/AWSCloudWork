After a message is polled by a consumer, it becomes invisible to other consumers
By default that message visibility timeout is 30 seconds
that means the message has 30 seconds to be proccessed
If another consumer requests the message in the visibility timeout period, it weill not be returned
After the messages visibility timeout is over, the message is visible in SQS
If a message is not proccess within the visibility timeout window, it will be proccessed twice
a consumer could call the ChangeMessageVisibility API to get more time
if visibility timeout is high (hours) and the consumer crashes, re-proccesing will take time
if too low, we may get duplicates
