When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with each other
there are two patterns of application communication
Synchronous communications (application to application)
Asynchronous/event based (application to queue to application)

Synchronous between applications can be problematic if sudden spikes of traffic
what if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually 10? TOO MUCH WORK
in that case, its better to decouple your applications
using SQS: queue model
using SNS: pub/sub model
Kinesis: Real-time streaming model
These services can scale independently from our application
