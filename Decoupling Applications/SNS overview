What if you want to send one message to many receivers? you use SNS
Pub/SUB is better
Buying service publishes in an SNS topic than the message gets received by the subscribers
The event producer only sends the message to one SNS topic
as many "event receivers" (subscriptions) as we want to listen to the SNS topic notification
Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages (note: new feature to filler messages)
up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic (change over time)
100,000 topics limit (increase that limit)

SNS ---> PUBLISH TO SUBSCRIBERS
  Emails
  SMS and Mobile notifications
  HTTP(S) endpoints
