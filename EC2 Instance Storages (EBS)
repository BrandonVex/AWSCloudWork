EBS Overview

What's an EBS Volume?

An EBS (elastic block store) volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
it allows your instances to persist data, even after the ec2 is terminated
they can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the ccp level)
they are bound to a specific ability zone!!

Analogy : network usb stick
free tier: 30gb of free ebs storage of type general purpose (SSD) or magnetic per month

-----------------------

EBS VOLUME

its a network drive (not physical)
  it uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  it can be detached from an ec2 instance and attached to another one quickly

its locked to an availability zone
  an ebs volume in us-east-1 A cannot be attached to us-east-1 B
  to move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it

Have a provisioned capacity (size in GB's, and IOP) in advance - define ebs volume to perform
  you get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  you can increase the capacity of the drive over time

----------------------

EBS - Delete on termination attribute

controls the ebs behavior when an ec2 instance terminates
  Default - ticked for root volume
  other ebs volume is not deletes
this can be controlled by the AWS console
use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated

-------------------------

EBS Hands-on

Select Volumes
Create volume
Select volume type
  gp2
  gp3
  io1
  io2
  sc1
  st1
  standard
select AZ zone (same as instance)
Create volume

-----------------

To attach (volume)
Select volume
Action
Attach volume
Select instance
Attach volume

---------------

(This shows the volume)
Click instance
Storage tab
Volume interface


When you launch an instance, and you advance storage - you can view if "Delete if termination" is on and when you delete instance, the EBS volume gets deleted if the EBS volume is attached while termination

------------------------------
EBS Snapshots

Make a backup snapshot of your EBS volume at a point in time
not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
can copy snapshots across az or region

Basically to transfer ebs volume to take a snapshot on US-EAST-1A and restore it on US-EAST-1B

----------------------

EBS snapshots features

EBS snapshot archive
  move a snapshot to an archive tier that is 75% cheaper
  takes withing 24 to 72 hours for restoring an archive 

Recycle Bin for EBS snapshots
  Setup rules to retain deleted snapshot so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  Specify retention fro 1 day to 1 year

Fast Snapshot restore
  Force Full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on first use (costs a lot of $$$)

----------------------

EBS Snapshot hands-on

Make a snapshot
Select Volume
Actions
Create Snapshot

(Select snapshots)

Select snapshot
Copy snapshot
Select region

------------------------

Create a volume from snapshot

Select snapshot
Actions
Create new volume from snapshot
Sel;ect volume type
Select size
Select AZ
Create Volume

----------

Make a recycle bin

Select snapshot
Click recycle bin
Retention rule name
Select resource type
select  apply to all resources (optional)
Select retention period
Select rule lock setting
  Locked
  Unlocked (common)
Create recycle bin

-----------------

How to recover from recycle bin

If deletion
Open recycle bin
Select volume/snapshot
Recover

EBS Volume types

Ebs volumes come in 6 types
  gp2/gp3 (SSD) general purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
  io1/io2 (ssd) higherst-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-trhoughput workloads
  st1 (HDD) low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed throughput-intensive workloads
  sc1 (HDD) lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads

How do you define an ebs volume?

Ebs volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS (I/O Ops per second)
When in doubt, always consult the AWS documentation - its good!
only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes

-----------

EBS VOLUME TYPE USE CASES

General purpose SSD
  Cost effective storage, low latency
  system boot volumes, virtual desktops, development and test environments
  1 GiB - 16 TiB of volume
  gp3: Newest
    baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s
    Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1000 MiB/s independently 
  gp2: older 
    small gp2 volumes that can burst IOPS to 3,000
    Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
    3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334 GB we are at max IOPS
      gp2/gp3 = COST EFFECTIVE STORAGE/LATENCY

Provision IOPS (PIOPS) SSD
  Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
  or applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
  Great for databases workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistently)
  io1/io2 (4GiB - 16TiB)
    Max PIOPS: 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances and 32,000 for others                     Nitro instaces = access to higher levels of IOPS
    can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
    io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GiB (at the same price as io1)
  io2 Block express (4GiB - 64TiB)
    Sub-millisecond latency
    Max PIOPS 256,000 with and IOPS:GiB ratio for 1,000:1
  Supports EBS multi-attach

Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
  Cannot be a boot volume
  125 GiB to 16 TiB
  Throughput optimized HDD (st1)
    Big data, data warehouses, log processing
    max throughput 500 MiB/s - max IOPS 500
  Cold HDD (sc1)
    for data that is infrequently accessed
    Scenarios where lowest cost is important
    max throughput 250 MiB/s - max IOPS 250
