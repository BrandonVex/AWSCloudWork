EBS Overview

What's an EBS Volume?

An EBS (elastic block store) volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
it allows your instances to persist data, even after the ec2 is terminated
they can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the ccp level)
they are bound to a specific ability zone!!

Analogy : network usb stick
free tier: 30gb of free ebs storage of type general purpose (SSD) or magnetic per month

-----------------------

EBS VOLUME

its a network drive (not physical)
  it uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  it can be detached from an ec2 instance and attached to another one quickly

its locked to an availability zone
  an ebs volume in us-east-1 A cannot be attached to us-east-1 B
  to move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it

Have a provisioned capacity (size in GB's, and IOP) in advance - define ebs volume to perform
  you get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  you can increase the capacity of the drive over time

----------------------

EBS - Delete on termination attribute

controls the ebs behavior when an ec2 instance terminates
  Default - ticked for root volume
  other ebs volume is not deletes
this can be controlled by the AWS console
use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated

-------------------------

EBS Hands-on

Select Volumes
Create volume
Select volume type
  gp2
  gp3
  io1
  io2
  sc1
  st1
  standard
select AZ zone (same as instance)
Create volume

-----------------

To attach (volume)
Select volume
Action
Attach volume
Select instance
Attach volume

---------------

(This shows the volume)
Click instance
Storage tab
Volume interface


When you launch an instance, and you advance storage - you can view if "Delete if termination" is on and when you delete instance, the EBS volume gets deleted if the EBS volume is attached while termination

------------------------------
EBS Snapshots

Make a backup snapshot of your EBS volume at a point in time
not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
can copy snapshots across az or region

Basically to transfer ebs volume to take a snapshot on US-EAST-1A and restore it on US-EAST-1B

----------------------

EBS snapshots features

EBS snapshot archive
  move a snapshot to an archive tier that is 75% cheaper
  takes withing 24 to 72 hours for restoring an archive 

Recycle Bin for EBS snapshots
  Setup rules to retain deleted snapshot so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  Specify retention fro 1 day to 1 year

Fast Snapshot restore
  Force Full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on first use (costs a lot of $$$)
