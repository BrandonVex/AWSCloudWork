EBS Overview

What's an EBS Volume?

An EBS (elastic block store) volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
it allows your instances to persist data, even after the ec2 is terminated
they can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the ccp level)
they are bound to a specific ability zone!!

Analogy : network usb stick
free tier: 30gb of free ebs storage of type general purpose (SSD) or magnetic per month

-----------------------

EBS VOLUME

its a network drive (not physical)
  it uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  it can be detached from an ec2 instance and attached to another one quickly

its locked to an availability zone
  an ebs volume in us-east-1 A cannot be attached to us-east-1 B
  to move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it

Have a provisioned capacity (size in GB's, and IOP) in advance - define ebs volume to perform
  you get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  you can increase the capacity of the drive over time

----------------------

EBS - Delete on termination attribute

controls the ebs behavior when an ec2 instance terminates
  Default - ticked for root volume
  other ebs volume is not deletes
this can be controlled by the AWS console
use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated
