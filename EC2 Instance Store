EC2 Instance store

EBS volumes are network drive with good but "limited" performance
if you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 instance store
  (name of the hardware attached to the server)


Better I/O performance
EC2 Instance store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content 
Risk of data loss if hardware fails
Make sure to backup data

This is meant for short term
