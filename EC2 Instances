EC2 Sizing & Config Options

Operation Systems
Linux
Windows
MacOS
How much computer power & cores (CPU)
How much random-access memory (RAM)
How much storage space
    Network-attached (EBS&EFS)
    Hardware (EC2 instance store)
Network card: Speed of the card, Public IP address
Firewall Rules: Security Group
Bootstrap script (Configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 INSTANCE TYPES

Seven different types of instances

General purpose
    Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
    Balance between
      Compute
      Memory
      Networking
    T2.micro being used in general
Compute-optimized
    Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
    Batch processing workloads
    Media transcoding
    High-performance web servers
    High performance computing (HPC)
    Scientific modeling & machine learning
    Dedicated gaming servers
      C FAMILY
Memory optimized
    Fast performance for workload that process large data sets in memory
    Use cases:
    High performance, relational/non-relational database
    Distributed web scale cache stores
    In-memory database optimized for BI (business intelligence) 
    Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
      R family (x1, high memory, z1)
Accelerated computing

Storage optimized
    Great for storage intensive tasks that require high sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
    Use cases
      High frequency online transaction processing systems
      Relations and NoSQL databases
      Cache for in memory databases
      Data warehousing applications
      Distributed file systems
        I, D or H1 family
Instance features
Measuring instance performance

EC2 Spot instance requests

Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to on-demand

Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
    The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
    If the current spot price> your max price you can choose to stop[ or terminate your instance within a 2 minute grace period

Spot Block
    Block spot instance during a specified time frame 1to 6 hours without interruptions


How to terminate spot instances?

Spot request
    Maximum price
    Desired number of instances
    Launch specification
    Request type: one time| persistent
    Valid from, valid until

You can only cancel spot instances requests that are open, active, or disabled.

Canceling a spot request does not terminate instances.

You must first cancel a spot request then terminate the associated spot instances.

---------------------------
Spot fleets

SPOT FLEETS = set of spot instances + (optional) on-demand instances

The spot fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints.

    Define possible launch pools: instance type, OS, AZâ€™s
    Can have multiple launch pools so that the fleet can choose
    Spot fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max costs

Lowestprice: from the pool with the lowest price
    Diversified: distributed across all pools (great for availability)
    Capacity optimized: po0ol with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
    Pricecapacityoptimized: pools with the highest capacity available, then select the pool with the lowest price (recommended)

---------------------------
Private vs Public IP vs Elastic IP

Networking has two sorts of IPs. IPv4 and IPv6

Ipv4 is the most common format used online
Ipv6 is newer and solves problems for the IoT
Ipv4 allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space

Public ip
    Public ip means the machine can be identified on the internet
    Must be unique across the whole web
    Can be geo-located easily

Private IP
    Private ip means the machine can only be identified on a private network only
    The ip must be unique across the private network
    But two different private networks cna have the same ip
    Machines connect to WWW using an internet gateway

Elastic IP
    When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP
    If you need to have a fixed public ip for your instance, you need an Elastic IP
    An elastic ip is a public ipv4 ip you own as long as you dont delete it
    With an elastic ip address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account
    Try to avoid
    5 elastic ips in AWS account

When we are doing SSH into our EC2
    We cant use a private ip
    We can only use public ip
