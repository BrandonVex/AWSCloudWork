EC2 INSTANCE TYPES

Seven different types of instances

General purpose
    Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
    Balance between
      Compute
      Memory
      Networking
    T2.micro being used in general
Compute-optimized
    Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
    Batch processing workloads
    Media transcoding
    High-performance web servers
    High performance computing (HPC)
    Scientific modeling & machine learning
    Dedicated gaming servers
      C FAMILY
Memory optimized
    Fast performance for workload that process large data sets in memory
    Use cases:
    High performance, relational/non-relational database
    Distributed web scale cache stores
    In-memory database optimized for BI (business intelligence) 
    Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
      R family (x1, high memory, z1)
Accelerated computing

Storage optimized
    Great for storage intensive tasks that require high sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
    Use cases
      High frequency online transaction processing systems
      Relations and NoSQL databases
      Cache for in memory databases
      Data warehousing applications
      Distributed file systems
        I, D or H1 family
