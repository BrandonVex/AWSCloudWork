SSL TLS Basics

An ssl certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)

SLL refers to "Secure sockets layer"; used to encrypt connections
TLS refers to "Transport layer security; which is the newer "SSL"
Nowadays, TLS Certificate are mainly used, but people still refer as SSL
(TLS CERTIFICATE)

Public ssl certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA)
Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, etc...

attaching the SSL certificate to the load balancer, it encrypts the connection between the client and the load balancer

SSL Certificates have an expiration date you set and must be renewed

---------------------------------------

User ----> HTTPS (encrypted) ---> Load balancer

The load balancer uses an x.509 certificate (SSL/TLS)
You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS certificate manager)
You can create and upload your own certificates alternatively 
HTTPS Listener: 
  specify default certificate
  you can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
  Clients can use SNI (server name indication) to specify the hostname they reach
  Ability to specify a security policy to older versions of SSL/TLS (legacy)

--------------------------------------------

SNI - Server name indication

  SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server (to server multiple websites)

  It's a "newer" protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake (makes sure same SSL is used every time for specific traffic)

  The server will then find the correct certificate or return the default one

Note:

  Only works for ALB & NLB (newer generations) and cloudfront
  Does not work for CLB (older gen)

-------------------------------------------

Target group for www.mycorp.com ------------------------ 

Target group for domain1.example.com ----------------------------


ALB - 2 certificates
  1. domain1.example.com
  2. www.mycorp.com
    These correspond with each target group

The client connects to ALB and wants www.mycorp.com and then the ALB used certificate #2 and encrypt the traffic and then redirects to the right target group

-------------------------------------------

Classic Load Balancer
  Supports 1 ssl certificate
  Must use multiple clb for multiple hostname

Application Load Balancer
  Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certs
  uses server name indication to work

Network Load balancer 
  Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certs
  uses server name indication to work
