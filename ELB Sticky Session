Sticky sessions (Session Affinity)

It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer (Basically all the client requests will go to the same instances)

This can be used for ALB and NLB
The "cookie" used for stickiness has an experation date that you control (NLB works without cookies)
Use cases:
  Make sure the user doesnt lose his session data 
Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend of EC2 instances
