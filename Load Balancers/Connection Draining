Feature Naming
  Connection Draining -- FOR CLB
  Deregistration Delay -- For ALB & NLB

It gives the Time to complete "in flight requests" while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy 
Stops sending new requests to the ec2 instance which is de-registering 
      (basically this makes sure traffic wont get caught in the turning off faze)

Between 1 to 3600 seconds of drain time (default 300)
can be disabled
Set to a low value if requests are short
Long requests should be set higher
