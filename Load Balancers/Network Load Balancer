Network Load Balancer (v2)

Network load balancer is a layer 4 balancer
  Allows you to:
  Fowards TCP & UDP Traffic to your instances
  Handle millions of requests per second
  less latency ~ 100ms (ALB = 400ms)

NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP
Helpful for whitelisting specific IPS

NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
Not included in the AWS free tier

----------------------------

NLB Target groups

EC2 instance (NLB Can use these)
IP addresses (Must be private)
Application Load Balancer - This can be in front of the ALB
   WHY? You can get the rules from the ALB but the security from the NLB
Health checks support the TCP, HTTP, HTTPS protocols
