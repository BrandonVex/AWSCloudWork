Aurora is a propietary from AWS (not open source)
Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x performance of Postgres on RDS
Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128TB!
Aurora can have up to 15 read replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL (sub 10ms replica lag)
Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It's HA native
Aurora Costs more than RDS (20% more) - but way more efficient
-------------------------
High availability and read scaling
6 copies of your data across 3 AZs
  4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
  3 copies out of 6 for reads
  self healing with peer-to-peer replication
  storage is striped across 100s of volumes
    you dont mess with storage - amazon does this
One aurora instance takes writes (master)
Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
Master + up to 15 aurora read replicas server reads
Support cross region replication 
-------------------------
Aurora DB cluster
Shared storage volume 10gb - 128tb
Master only thing that writes to your storage
Writer endpoint will always be pointed to the master
Read replicas can also have auto-scaling
Reader endpoint connection load balancing - connects automatically to all read replicas - load balancing done this way
Load balancing happens at the connection level not statement level
