Aurora Auto Scaling
---
Custom Endpoints

---> 2 different type of replicas -- 2 db.r3.large | 2 db.r5.2xlarge

Define a subset of aurora instances as a custom endpoint
example: run analytic queries on specific replicas
The reader endpoint is generally not used after defining custom endpoints
Allows you to query a subset

------------

Serverless

Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
Good for infrequent intermittent or unpredictable workloads
No capacity planning needed
pay per second can be more cost-effective
-----------

Aurora multi-master

In case you want continuous write availability for the writer nodes
every node does R/W vs promoting a read replica as the new master
---------

Global aurora

Aurora cross region read replicas
  useful for disaster recovery
  simple to put in place
aurora global database (recommended)
  1 primary region R/W
  Up to 5 secondary (read only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
  up to 16 read replicas per secondary region
  Helps for decreasing latency
  Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute
Typical cross-region replication takes less than 1 second ---------------------------------------------> HINT
