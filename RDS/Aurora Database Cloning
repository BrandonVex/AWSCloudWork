Create a new Aurora DB cluster from an existing one
Faster than snapshot&restore
Usees a COpy-on-Write protocol
  initially the new DB cluster uses the same data volume as the original DB cluster (fast and efficient - no copying needed)
  when updates are made to the new DB cluster data, then additional storage is allocated and data is copied to be seperated
very fast and cost effective
useful to create a "Staging" database from a production database without impacting the production database
