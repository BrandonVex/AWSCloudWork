The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Detabases....
ElastiCache is to get managed Redit Or Memcached
Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
Help reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
Helps make your application stateless
AWS take care of OS maintenance/ patching, optimizations, setup, configs, monitoring, failure recovery, and backups
Using ELASTICACHE involves heavy application code changes
  this is not something youj enable and go
  you must configure the query prior to elasticache

Solution Architecture - DB Cache

Applications queries ElastiCache, if not avaliable, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache
Cache HIT automattically gets it from elasticache
Helps relieve load in RDS
Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in here

Solution Architecture - User Session Store

User logs into any of the applications
The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
The user hits another instance of our application - than your application can recieve the application cache and restore the cache for uiser doesnt need to relog

Redis vc Memchaced

Redis
  Multi  Az with auto failover
  Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability
  Data durability using AOF persistence
  Backup and restore features
  Supports Sets and Sorted sets - Key Words
Memchaced
  Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding)
  No high availability (replication)
  Non persistent
  No Backup and restore
  Multi-threaded architecture
Redis is for high availability/backup while mechached is a pure cache distributed
