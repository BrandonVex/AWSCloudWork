RDS Backups

Automated backups
  daily full backup of the database (during the backup window)
  transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
  => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
  1 to 35 days of retention, set 0 to disable automated backups
Manual DB Snapshots
  manually triggered by the user
  retention of backup for as long as you want

Trick: in a stopped RDS database, you will still pay for storage, if you plan on stopping it for a long time, you should snapshot and restore instead.
if you need this DB for short time like 2 hours a week, make snapshot

--------

Aurora Backups
