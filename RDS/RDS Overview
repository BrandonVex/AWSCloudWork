RDS stands for relational database service
its a managed DB service for DB that uses SQL as a query language
it allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  postgress
  MySQL
  MariaDB
  ORacle
  Microsoft SQL Server
  Aurora (AWS propietary server)

--------------

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC@

RDS is a managed service
  automated provisioning, OS patching
  continous backups and restore to specific timestamp (point in time restore)
  monitoring dashboards
  read replicas for improved read performance
  multi az setup for DR (disaster recovery)
  maintenanance windows for upgrades
  scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
But you cant SSH into your instances!!!!

since this is an AWS managed service we dont have access to the underlying EC2 instance
