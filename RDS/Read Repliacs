RDS read replicas for read scalability
Create up to 15 read replicas
Within AZ, Cross AZ, or Cross region
REpliation is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas
Read replicas are only for reads

----> Use cases
You have a production database that is taking on normal load
You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
You create a read replica to run the new workload there ---> Async --> reads to reporting application analytics)
The production Application is unaffected
Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (non INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

------> Network cost

IN AWS theres a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
FOR RDS read replica within the same region, you dont pay that FEE -- because RDS is a managed service
If you are using a cross region replica, than you would have to pay a fee
