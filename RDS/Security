RDS & aurora Security

AT rest encryption:
  database master & replicas encryption using AWS KMS - must be defined at launch time
  if the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
  to encrypt an un-encrypted database, go Through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted

In-flight encryption: TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificates client-side
IAM Authentication: IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of pass/username)
Security Groups: Control Network access to your RDS /aurora DB
No SSH is available except for RDS Custom
Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to cloudwatch logs for longer retention
