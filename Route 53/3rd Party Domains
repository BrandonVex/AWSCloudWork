You buy or register your domain name with a Domain registrar typically by paying annual charges
The domain registrar usually provides you with a DNS service to manage your DNS Records
But you can use another DNS service to manage your DNS records
  Example: purchase from godaddy, use AWS for DNS
  Change name servers into AWS servers for it can be queried there
If you buy your domain on a 3rd pary registrar you can still use route 53 as DNS service provide by
  Creating a hosted zone in route 53
  update NS records on 3rd party website to route into route 53 name servers
Domain registrar is not the same as DNS Service
But every domain registrar usually comes with some DNS features
