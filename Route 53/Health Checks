HTTP Health Checks are only for public resources
  Route 53 for DNS Records
Create health checks from route 53 to make sure incase for failover
Health check => automated DNS Failover
  Health Checks that monitor an endpoint
  Health Checks that monitor other health checks
  Health checks that monitor cloudwatch alarms (full control) (private resources)
Health checks are integrated with CW metrics

--------------

Monitor and Endpoint
Health checks send a request to an ALB than recieve a 200 http code on success

About 15 global health checkers will check the endpoint health
  Healthy/unhealthy threshold - 3 
  interval - 30 (can set to 10 sec - higher cost)
  Supported protocol: HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP
  if > 18% of health checkers report the endpoint, route 53 considers it healthy.
  Ability to choose which locations you want Route 53 to use
Health checks pass only when the endpoint responds with the 2xx or 3xx status codes
Health checks can be setup to pass / fail based on the text in the first 5120 bytes of the response
configure your router/firewall to allow incoming incoming requests from route 53 health checkers

------------------------

Calculated health checks

Combine the results of multiple health checks into a single health checks
you can use OR, AND, or NOT
Can monitor up to 256 child health checks
specify how many health checks need to pass the parent pass
usage: perform maintenance to your website without causing all health checks to failover

-----------------------

Private hosted zones

Route 53 health checkers are outside of the VPC
They cannot access private endpoints
To Do:
  You can create a cloudwatch metric and associate a cloudwatch alarm, then create a health check that checks the alarm itself
