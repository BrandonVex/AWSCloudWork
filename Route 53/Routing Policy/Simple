Define How Route 53 responds to DNS Queries
Dont get confused with the word "routing"
  Its not the same as a load balancer routing which roots the traffic
  DNS does not route any traffic, it only responds to the DNS queries - helps translates hostnames

Route 53 Simple Policy

Typically route traffic to a single resource
Can specify multiple values in the same record
If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client
When Alias enabled, you can only specify only an AWS resource
Cant be associated with health checks
