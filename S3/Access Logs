For audit purposes you may want to log all access to S3 Buckets
any requests made to S3 FROM ANY ACCOUNT, authorized or denied, will be logged into another s3 bucket
that data can be analyzed using data analysis tools... (aws athena)
The target logging bucket must be in the same AWS region
Specific log formats

warning:
  do not set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket
