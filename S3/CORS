Cross Origin Resource Sharing
Origin = scheme (protocol) + host (domain) + port
  Example: https://www.example.com (implied port is 433 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)
Web browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin
  Same origin: https://www.example.com (appl1) and (appl2)
  Different origins https://www.example.com and https://other.example.com
The requests wont be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests using CORS HEADERS (example: Access Control Allow Origin)

If a client makes a cross origin request on our s3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers
its a popular exam question
you can allow for a specific origin or for (*  (all))

CORS is a web browser security that allows you to enable images or assets from  an s3 bucket from another origin
