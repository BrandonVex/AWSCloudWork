You can transition objects between storage classes
For infrequently access object, moves them to standard IA
For archive objects that you dont need fast access to, move them to glacier/deep archive
moving objects can be automated by lifecycle rules

----------------
S3 Lifecycle rules

Transition actions - configure objects to transition to another storage class
  move to standard ia class after 60 days
  move to glacier for archiving after 6 months
Expiration Actions - configure objects to delete after some time
  access log files can be set to delete after 365 days
  Can be used to delete old versions of files
  can be used to delete incomplete multi part uploads
Rules can be created for a certain prefix
rules can be created for certain object tags
------------------------------------
your application  on ec2 create images thumbnails after profile photos are uploaded to amazon s3. these thumbnails can be easily recreated, and only need to be kept for 60 days.
the source images should be able to be immediately retrieved for these 60 days and afterwards, the user can wait up to 6 hours. how would you design this?

s3 source images can be on standard with a lifecycle config to transition into glacier after 60 days
s3 thumbnails can be on one zone ia with a lifecycle config to expire after 60 days
------------------------------------
A rule in your company states that you should be able too recover your deleted s3 objects immediately for 30 days, although this may happen rarely
after this time, and for up to 365 days, deleted objects should be recoverable in 48 hours. make a life cycle rule

Enable S3 versioning, to keep objects hidden with a delete marker
transition the noncurrent versions of the object to standard IA
transition afterwards the noncurrent versions to glacier deep archive
