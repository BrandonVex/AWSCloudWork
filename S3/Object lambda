Use AWS lambda functions to change the object before its retrieved by the caller application
only one s3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create S3 ACCESS POINT and S3 OBJECT LAMBDA ACCESS POINT

Supporting s3 access point --->redacting lambda function ----> s3 object lambda access point ---> analytics application (redacted objects)
Supporting s3 access point --->Enriching lambda function ----> s3 object lambda access point ---> Marketing application (Enriching)

use cases:
  redacting personally identifiable information for analytics or non-production environments
  converting across data formats such as converting XML to JSON
  resiuzing and watermarking images on the fly using caller specific details such as the user who requested the object
