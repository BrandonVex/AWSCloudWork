S3 - BUCKETS

Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions) 
Buckets are defined at the region level
S3 Looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
Naming convention
  no uppercase, no underscore
  3-63 characters long
  NOT AN IP
  must start with a lowercase letter or number
  Must not start with the prefix xn--
  Must not end with the suffix -s3alias

----------------------------

S3 - OBJECT

Objects (files) have a key
the key is  the FULL path
  s3://my-bucket/(my_file.txt) Just the file
  s3://my-bucket/(my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt) Folders
Key is composed of prefix + object name
  s3://my-bucket/(my_folder1/another_folder/)<----- Prefix / suffix ----->(my_file.txt)
There's non concept of directories within buckets
just keys with very long names contain slashes (/)

Object values are the content of the body:
  Max object size is 5TB
  if uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
Metadata (list of key/value pairs - system or user metadata)
Tags (unicode key/ value pair - up to 10) - useful for security/lifecycle
Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
