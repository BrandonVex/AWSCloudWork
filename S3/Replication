CRR (Cross region Replication) and SRR (Same region Replication)
When you have 2 buckets in different regions and you want an  asynchronous replication
  Enable versioning in source and destination bucket
  Cross Region Replication 
  Same Region Replication
  Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
  Copying happens asynchronous
  must give proper IAM permissions to s3
Use cases:
  CRR - Compliance, lower latency, replication across accounts
  SRR - log aggregaton, live replication between production and test accounts

NOTES:

After you enable replication, only new objects are replicated
optionally: you can replicate existing objects using s3 batch replication
  replicates the existing objects and that failed replication

For deletes option
  can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional)
  deletions with a version ID are not replicated (avoid malicious deletes)

There is not chaining of replication
  If bucket 1 replicates into 2 and 2 replicates into 3
  1 will not replicate into 3 - only 2
