In general, bucket owners pay for all amazon s3 storage, and data transfer costs associated with their bucket
with requester pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner will pay the cost of the request and the data downloaded from the bucket
helpful when you want to share large datasets with other accounts
the requester must be authenticated in AWS (not anonymous)
