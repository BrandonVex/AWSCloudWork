Security

User based
  IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
Resource bases
  Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the s3 console - allow cross account
  Object Access Control List - finer grain 
  Bucket Access Control List - less common
Most COmmon way : bucket policies

Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if:
  The user IAM permissions allow it or the resource policy allows it
  and theres no explicit deny 

Encryption: encrypt the object in AWS S3 using encryption keys

-------------------

Bucket Policy

JSON based polices!
  Resources: buckets and objects
  Effect: Allow / Deny
  Actions: set of API to allow or Deny
  Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to! (*)
Use s3 bucket policy to
  Grant public access to the bucket
  force objects to be encrypted at upload
  grant access to another account

------------------------

If you know your bucket should never be public, leave AWS settings ON
Can be set at account level
