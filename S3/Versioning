You can version your files in Amazon s3
it is enabled at the bucket level 
Version => Updates
Same key overwrite will change the "version" 1,2,3,4,5
it is best practice to version your buckets
  protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  easy roll back to previous version
notes:
  any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"
  Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

----------------------> Hands-on

Select your bucket properties
edit bucket versioning
enable
Edit your HTML file
Upload File again
Now that file has versioning (show versions)

Null = uploaded prior to versioning
Version ID = Versioning
