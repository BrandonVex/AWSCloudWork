Security groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances


-----------------------

Security groups only contain ALLOW rules
Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group.

Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on ec2 instances
They regulate
  Access to ports
  Authorised IP ranges - ipv4 and ipv6
  Control of inbound network
  Control of outbound network
---------------------

Security groups good to know

Can be attached to multiple instances
Locked down to a region/VPC combination
Does live outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance wont see it
Its good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
If your application is not accessible (time out), then its a security group issue
If your application gives a “connection refused” error, then its an application error or its not launched
All inbound traffic is blocked by default
All outbound traffic is allowed by default
