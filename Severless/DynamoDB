Fully managed database, highly available with replication across multiple AZs
NoSQL datatbase - not a relational database with transaction support
scales to massive workloads, distributed database
Millions of requests per second, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage
Fast and consistent in performance (single digit miliseconds)
integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration
Low cost and auto-scaling capabilities
no maintenance or patching, always available
Standard & Infrequent Access databases
-------------------

DynamoDB is made of TABLES
Each table will have a primary key (decided at creation time)
Each table can have an infinite number of items (=rows)
Each item has attributes (can be added overtime -- null also)
Maximum size of an item is 400KB
Datat types:
  Scalar types - string, number, binary, boolean, null
  Docs - list, map
  Set Types - sTRING SET, bINARY SET, NUMBER SET
Therefore in DynamoDB you can rapidly evolve SCHEMAS <---- important

-------------------

READ/WRITE

Control how you manage your tables capcaity
Provisioned mode
  You specify the number of read/writes per second
  you need to plan capacity beforehand
  Pay for ptovisioned read capacity units and write capacity units
  Possibility to add auto-scaling mode for RCU and WCU
  Predictable/smoothly
On-Demand
  Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads
  no capacity planning needed
  pay for what you use, more expensive
  Great for unpredictable workloads, steep sudden spikes



KEY WORDS:  Provisioned, Auto-scaling, Unpredictable, Steep Sudden Spikes, SCHEMA
