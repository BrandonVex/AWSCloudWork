Serveless is a new paradigm in which the developers dont have to manage serveres anymore
they just deploy code
they just deploy functions
initially serverless == FaaS
Serverless was pioneered by AWS lambda but now also includes anything thats managed: databases, messaging, storage etc...
serverless does not mean there are no serveres, it just means you dont manage or provision them
