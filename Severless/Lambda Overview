What is AWS Lambda?

Lambda:
  Virtual Functions - no servers to manage
  Limited by time - short executions
  Run On-Demand
  Scaling is automated

---------------------

Benefits of Lambda

Easy pricing:
  Pay per request and compute time
  Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS lambda requests and 400,00 GBs of compute time

Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
integrated with many programming languages
easy monitoring through AWS cloudwatch
Easy to get more resources per function
Increasing ram will also improve CPU and Network <----------- KNOW

-------------------------

Language Support

Node.js
Python
Java (8)
C# (.NET core)
Golang
C#/powershell
Ruby
Custom Runtime API

Lambda container image
  the container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API
  ECS / Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary docker images

--------------------------

Main Ones : intergrations

API Gateway 
Kineses (data transformations)
DynamoDB (Triggers)
S3 (triggered for file creation)
CloudFront (lambda at edge)
EventBridge (infratructure reaction)
SNS (react to notifications)
SQS (Perform the queues)
CloudWatchLogs
Cognito (react to when users enter database)

--------------------

Lambda Pricing Examples

Pay Per calls:
  1,000,000 requeust for free
  0.20$ per 1 million requests after
Pay per duration: in increments of 1 ms
  400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month for free
  == 400,000 seconds if function is 1GB ram
  == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128GBof ram
  after that $1.00 for 600,000 GBs
It is usually very cheap to run AWS lambda so its popular
