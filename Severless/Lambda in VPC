Lambda by default

By default your lambda function is launched outside your own VPC < ----- AWS owned VPC
therefore it cannot access resourceses in your VPC <---- yours / doesnt work

Lambda VPC

you must define the VPC ID, the subnets and the security group
Lambda will create an ENI in your subnets (Elastic Network Interface)

Lambda with RDS proxy

if lambda functions directly access your database, they may open too many connections under high load
instead - launch RDS proxy
RDS Proxy:
  Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connections
  Improve availability by 66% the failover time and preserving connections
  Improve security by enforcing IAM authentication and storing credentials in Secrets manager
The lambda function must be deploted in YOUR VPC, because RDS proxy is never publicly accessible
