Many modern applications execute some form of the logic at the edge
Edge functions:
  A code that you write and attach to CloudFront Distributions
  Runs close to your users to minimize latency
CloudFront provides two type: CloudFront Functions and Lambda@Edge
You dont have to manage any servers, deployed globally

Use case: Customize CDN content
pay only for what you use
Fully serverless
-----------------

Use cases:

Website security and Privacy
Dynamic Web application at the edge
Search engine optimization (SEO)
Intelligently Route across origins and data centers
bot mitigation at the edge
real-time imahge transformation
A/B testing
user authentication and authorization
user prioritization
user tracking and analytics

-------------------------

CloudFront Functions:

Lightweight function written in javascript
for high-scale, latency sensitive CDN customizations
Sub-ms startup times, millions of requests/second
used to change viewer requests and responses
  Viewer requests: after cloudfron receives a request from a viewer
  Viewer response: before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer
Native featur of cloudfront (managed within cloudfront)
Millions of requests per second
Max execution time <1ms

---------------------------

Lambda@Edge

Lambda functions written in NodeJS or Python
Scales up to 1000s of requests/second
used to change cloudfron requests and responses
  viewer requests - after cloudfront receives a request from a viewer
  origin requests - before cloudfront forwards the request to the origin
  origin response - after cloudfront recieves the response from the origin
  viewer response - before cloudfront forwards the response to the viewer
Author your functions in one AWS region, then cloudfron replicates to its locations
Max execution time 5-10 seconds


------------------------

CloudFront:
  Cache Key normilization
  Header Manipulation
  Url rewrites or reditects
  Request authentication and authorization
Lambda@Edge
  Longer execution time
  Adjustable CPU or Memory
  youre code depends on a 3rd library
  Network access to use external services for processing
  file system access or access to the body of HTTP requests
