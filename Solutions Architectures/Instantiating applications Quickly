When launching a full stack (ec2,ebs,rds) it can take time to
  install applications
  Insert inital or recovery data
  Configure everything
  Launch the application
We can take advantage of the cloud to speed it up!

EC2 Instances
  Use a Golden AMI: install your applications, OS Dependencies, before hand and launch your EC2 instances from the GOlden AMI 
    Future instances will have these already done because of golden ami
  Bootstrap using user data: for dynamic configuration, use user data scripts (bootstrapping: means basically configuring the instance when it first starts)
  Hybrid: Mix Golden AMI and User Data (Elastic beanstalk)
RDS Databases
  Restore from a snapshot the database: will have schemas and data ready (which is much better than using a big insert state.)
EBS Volumes
  Restore from a snapshot: the disk will already be formatted and have the data (gets rid of having a disk from non formatted)
Speed up- think like an architect
"whats slow,what can we make faster"
