Launch 3rd party high performance file system on was
fully managed service
fsx IS same as RDS but for files
-------------

FSx for WIndows

FSx for windows is fully managed windows file system share drive
supports SMB protocol and windows NTFS
microsoft active directory integration, ACL user quotas.
can be mounted on linux ec2 instances
supports microsoft DFS namespaces
scale up to 10s of gb/s millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
Storage options
  SSD - latencry sensitive workloads
  HDD - broad spectrum of workloads
can be accessed from your on premises infrastructure (VPN or direct connect)
can be configured to be multi-az
data is backedup daily to S3

---------------

FSx for Lustre

Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large scale computing
the name lustre is derived from linux and cluster

Machine Learning High performance computing (HPC) <------ know
Video processing, financial modeling, electronic design automation
scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latency
Storage options
  SSD: - low latency, IOPS intensive workload, small and random file operations
  HDD - throughput intensive workloads, large and sequential file operations
seamless integration with S3
  can read s3 as a file system
  can write the output of the computations back to s3
Can be used from on-premises servers

----------------

FSx file system deployment options

Scratch file system
  temporary storage
  data is not replicated (basically lost on fail)
  high burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
  Use cases: 
    short term processing, optimized costs
Persistent file system
  long term storage
  data is replicated in same AZ
  replace failed files within minutes
  usage:
    long term processing, sensitive data
