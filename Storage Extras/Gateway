AWS Wants to start Hybrid Cloud!

----------------
AWS Storage gateway

Bridge between on premises data and cloud data
use cases:
  disaster recovery
  backup and restore
  tiered storage
  on-premises cache and low-latency files access
types of storage gateway
  S3
  FSx
  Volume
  Tape
----------------------

S3 File Gateway

Configured s3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
supports all tierings
transition to s3 glacier using lifecycle policy
bucket access using IAM roles for each file gateway
SMB protocol has integration with active directory for user authentication

-------------

FSx File Gateway

Native access to Amazon FSx for windows file server
Local cache for frequently accessed data
windows native compatibility (SMB NTFS, AD)
useful for group file shares and home directories
-----------------------------

Volume Gateway

Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes
Cached volumes: Low latency access to most recent data
stored volumes: entire dataset is on-premise, scheduled backups to s3
-----------

Tape gateway

Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes
with tape gateway, companies use the same processes but, in the cloud
Virtual Tape Library backed by amazon S3 and glacier
back up data using existing tape-based processes 
work with leading backup software vendors

--------------

Hardware appliances

using storage gateway means you need on premises virtualization
otherwise, you can use a storage gateway hardware appliance
you can buy it on amazon.com
works with file, volume, tape gateway
Has the required CPU, memory, network and SSD cache resources
helpful for daily NFS backups in small data centers
