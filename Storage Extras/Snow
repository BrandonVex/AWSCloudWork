AWS Snow family

Highly secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS

Data migration:
  snowcone
  snowball edge
  snowmobile
Edge COmputing
  Snowcone
  snowball edge

------------------

Data migrations, Why? With snow?

If it takes more than a week to transfer, use snowball devices
offline devices to perform data migrations
this is a physical device!

---------------

sNOWBALL EDGE (FOR DATA TRANSFERS)

Physical data transportation solution: moves tbs or pbs of data in or out of was
alternative to moving data over the network
pay per data transfer job not network prices
provide block storage and amazon s3 compatible object storage
Snowball edge storage optimized
  80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume or s3 compatible object storage
Snowball Edge COmpute Optimized
  42 TB of HDD or 28 TB NVMe capacity for block volume and s3 compatible object storage
use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery

-----------------
SNOWCONE

small portable computing, anywhere, rugged, and secure withstands harsh environments
light
device used for edge computing, storage, and data transfer
snowcone - 8TB of HDD storage
Snowcone SSD - 14TB of SSD storage
you use snowcone where snowball does not fit
must provide your own battery/cables
can be sent back to AWS offline or connect it to internet and use AWS dataSync to send data

--------------

SNOWMOBILE

Actual Truck
Transfer Exabytes of data (1 EB = 1000 PB = 1,000,000 TBS)
each snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
high security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
BETTER than snowball if you transfer more than 10PB of data

---------------

usage process

Request snowball devices from the aws console for delivery
install the snowball client / aws OpsHub on your servers
connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
ship back the device when youre done (goes to the right aws facility)
data will be loaded into an s3 bucket
snowball is completely wiped

-------------------------

What is edge computing?

Proccess data while its being created on an edge location
  a truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground
these locations have limited/no access to internet or computing power
we setup a snowball edge / snowcone device to do edge computing
use cases:
  preprocess data
  machine learning at the edge
  transcoding media streams
eventually, we can ship back the device to AWS

----------------------------

Edge computing

Snowcone and Snowcone SSD (smaller)
  2 Cpus, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless
  USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
Snowball edge - compute optimized
  104 VCPUsm 416 GiB of ram
  optinal GPU (video proccess or machine learning
  28 TB NVMe or 42TB HDD usable storage
  storage clustering available (16 nodes)
Snowball edge - storage optimized
  up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of ram, 80 TB of storage
ALL:  can run EC2 instances and LAMBDA functions using IoT GreenGrass
long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing

-----------------------------

OpsHub

Historically to use snow family devices, you needed a CLI
today you can use OpsHub ( a software you install on your computer) to manage your snow family devices
  unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
  transferring files
  launching and managing instances running on Snow
  monitor device metrics
  launch compatible AWS services on your device
